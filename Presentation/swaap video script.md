## product

swaap! it's the brand new app that makes networking and following up at conferences ***easy***!

After signing up, provide your contact information and anything else you'd like to share with the people you network with. Make it personal by including a special tagline that can make you stand out!

Do you prefer email? Phone conversations? Or wait, I know... You're a social media person! Pick your preferred contact method to let others know how you prefer to communicate!

Don't forget to show off your pretty face!



In the connect tab, you can share your QR code with others to 'swaap' with them! `swaaping` is very easy. 

To send a connection request, tap the camera button and simply point at a swaap QR code. Your phone will give you haptic feedback and inform you that a connection request has been sent.

The QR code button will reveal your very own QR code.

When someone sends you a connection request, you will see it in your notifications tab!

Simply tap on "accept" and you will have 'swaaped' your contact information!

Now your new contact will appear in your contacts tab!

When viewing a contact card, you'll see their preferred form of contact. Swipe up to reveal the rest of their information, such as where you met and other contact alternatives.

And once you've made a connection, you can refer to where you met that person to help jog your memory of who they are!

If you don't have an iPhone, we also have a web app..

With the web app you can sign in from any device, phone, or computer. 

The web app has a lot of the same features as the iOS app, such as updating your profile, viewing your contacts, or even swaaping your contact information! It works on Android too!

## architecture

Our backend consists of nodejs using GraphQL and a Postgres database, deployed on heroku. Our frontend is built using React with the Apollo Client, and using Tailwind for the CSS framework. Cloudinary is used for image storage and Auth0 is used for authentication.

The phone app is written in Swift and UIKit using many new features in iOS 13, with very few 3rd party dependencies!


## goals

Setting out, we wanted to make an app that's engaging and gives users a centralized location to keep in contact with all their newly networked connections.


## challenges

Challenges we faced on the web were scanning and reading qr codes. We tied together our own solution using supplementary libraries. Additionally, GraphQL was new to everyone and the differences from a typical REST API required some adjustments.

However, our talented team of software engineers was up to the task and produced an incredible networking app!
